# Hand-Controlled-Volume

In this project I have used OpenCV to detect the user's hand and, according to the distance between the thumb and the index finger, set the volume of your machine.

When running the project, you will be promoted with a live window that shows what your camera sees. The program will detect your hand and, set the volume if you put down your pinky finger. Have fun!

The idea for this project came upon seeing a video on LinkedIn but also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iEPzbG-xLE&t=1790s) tutorial video on YouTube.
